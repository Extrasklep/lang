Sorry if this sucks

Basic syntax:
[input][sign][output];

Input can be a signed number, escaped letter, variable or "i" for stdin.
Output can be a variable or "o","r" for stdout.

Comments can be made with / and anything after ; in a line will be ignored.

Escapes:
Use \ to escape the character after it and turn it into a number.
\d would equal to 100.
This does not work with newlines and maybe some other special characters, use the character n to get a newline.
Example:
\d>>c0;
n>>c1;
c0>>r;
c1>>r;
c0>>r;
Output:
<d
d>End of output.

--VARIABLES--

To write or read a variable use "v[variable number]".
Variables are signed long integers in C/C++.
Example:
1234>>v0;
v0>>o;
Output:
> 1234

Char variables
To write or read a char variable use "c[variable number]".
Char variables should be used to store characters and smaller numbers.
Always unsigned [0-255], unsigned char in C/C++.
Example:
\A>>c0;
c0>>r;
Output:
A

There is a limit for each type of variables depending on your compiler/interpreter.
You can also put another variable as [variable number] to read the variable with the number of the first variable.
Example:
4>>c1;
7>>c2;
13>>c3;
3>>v1;
v1>?7;
1>?10;
cv1>>o; //outputs the value of char variable with the number stored in v1
1>-v1;
1>?5;
Output:
> 13
> 7
> 4

Converting char variables to normal variables and the other way should work fine (except overflows when converting a long integer to 8 bit integer).

--I/O--

i (input) -- Read a number from standard input.
This will always show "< " to notify the user that the program is asking for input.
Example:
i>>v0;
v0>>o;
Input:
< 123
Output:
> 123

o (output) -- Write a number to standard output.
This will always show "> " before the number and a newline after the number.
Example:
1234>>v0;
123>>c0;
v0>>o;
c0>>o;
Output:
1234
123

r (output) -- Raw output: write a byte to standard output.
Example:
\A>>c0;
100>>c1;
c0>>r;
c1>>r;


--SIGNS--

>> - Move/write
Writes input to output.
Example:
1234>>o;
Output:
> 1234

>? - If jump [input]>?[input];
Jumps to output line number if input is bigger than 0 (only bigger than 0, not negative numbers).
Example 1:
(1) i>>v0; //get input into variable
(2) v0>?4; //jump to 4 if v0 is bigger than 0
(3) 1>?6;  //jump to else 
(4) 1>>o;  //write 1 to output (if v0 is bigger than 0)
(5) 1>?7;  //jump to after else (end of code)
(6) 0>>o;  //write 0 to output (else)
Output 1:
< 5
> 1
Output 2:
< -5
> 0
Example 2: Simple loop
(1) 5>>v0; //starting number
(2) v0>?4; //jump to 4 if the number is bigger than 0
(3) 1>?7;  //else jump to end of code
(4) v0>>o; //write number to output
(5) 1>-v0; //decrement the number
(6) 1>?2;  //jump back to the beginning of the loop
Output:
> 5
> 4
> 3
> 2
> 1
Example 3: l (line) input type
Using l returns the number of the current line so you can jump to it later or output it for debugging.
(1) 2>>v0;
(2) l>>v1;
(3) v1>>o;
(4) 1>-v0;
(5) v0>?v1;
Output:
> 2
> 2

>+ - Add
Adds input to output.
Example:
2>+v0;
3>+v0;
v0>>o;
Output:
> 5

>- - Subtract
Subtracts input from the output.
Example:
5>>v0;
2>-v0;
v0>>o;
Output:
> 3

>* - Multiply
Multiplies output by the input.
Example:
5>>v0;
3>*v0;
v0>>o;
Output:
> 15

>/ - Divide
Divides output by the input.
Example:
15>>v0;
3>/v0;
v0>>o;
Output:
> 5

--LETTERS--
\ - Letter escape. Returns the number of the letter after it.
This will not work with new lines and maybe some other characters that aren't normal.
Example:
\d>>v0;
v0>>o;
v0>>r;
Output:
> 100
d

o - Output for numbers. This will output a number even from char variables and will always put "> " before the number and a new line after.
Example:
5>>v0;
\ >>c0;
1>>o;
v0>>o;
c0>>o;
Output:
> 1
> 5
> 32

i - Input for numbers. This will return a number from standard input and will always output "< " before listening to input to notify the user that the program is asking for input.
Example:
i>>v0;
v0>>o;
Output:
< 5
> 5

r - Raw output for characters. This will output the input as a char and not put anything before or after it.
Example:
0>>c0;
\d>>v0;
\d>>c1;
100>>c2;
c0>>r;
v0>>r;
c1>>r;
c2>>r;
Output:
ddd

l - Current line number. Returns the number of the current line to use for jumping to it later or debugging.
Example:
(1)
(2) //Comment
(3) l>>v0;
(4) 
(5) v0>>o;
Output:
> 3

n - New line character. Returns the number of the newline character.
Example:
\d>>c0;
n>>c1;
c0>>r;
c1>>r;
n>>r;
Output:
<d

>
