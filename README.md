# lang

A simple language I made in a few days.

You can't really do much with it except basic input and output but it should be a complete language

This was a stupid project done in a few days, the interpreter and code quality aren't great and this will probably not get any new updates.

There is also a basic tester in /tester if you'd like to confirm that the interpreter is working, if you want to make changes to it, or if you want to write your own interpreter.
